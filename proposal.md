**Feedback:**
Many people asked what makes this idea novel, so we looked at a lot of the competition. Every other option for flights that we can find forces you to pick where you'd like to go and when you'd like to leave. For many people, their wanderlust drives them to pick up any opportunity they can find to travel on the cheap, and picking dates or places only gets in the way. While asking for noundaries for a search query is logical, it goes against the reason people might be looking in the first place.

In sum, our feedback helped us solidify a unique value prop by focusing on immediate results over customized queries.

**Features:**
(what we want to see as features in the project)

**Work Flow:**
We all plan on touching all parts of the code. We will likely set weekly goals in 'scrum'-like meetings and divide the work up then based on availability and skillsets for each given set of tasks at hand.
