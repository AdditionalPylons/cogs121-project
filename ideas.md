**Ideas for Project**

1. World Map showing cheapest flights from your location to other countries represented as pins, encourages travel amongst those traveling on a budget 

2. Interface for choosing locations to explore in CAVEKiosk exhibit in Geisel.

3. App to help promote events and orgs on campus by using a map to show the location, describe the events, and allow a centralized format for students to discover orgs. Fight against UC Socially Dead.

4. Tour guide for people who don't want a tour guide. Triton Tour.

5. Looks for trails to walk around on campus.

6. Visualization of github commits around the world, sorting ability to see where people are working on projects similar to yours
